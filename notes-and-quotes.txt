It is a visualization aid designed to help web teams integrate accessible design choices into their practices which will result in websites that are more likely to comply with the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0). The poster aims to help all members of the web development team - designers, developers, writers and project managers - better understand what to do, and what it takes to make sites accessible. Each stair represents a content type or design decision that could potentially introduce a barrier to a person with a disability. Associated with each stair is list of accessible techniques that when implemented with build in the virtual the ramp ensuring access to that web content. The action-based techniques (or ramp) focus on the WCAG's POUR principles in order to help teams develop sites that are perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. By focusing on the guidelines's principles and clear action-based techniques we teams can 

 The visualization is meant to focus on the guiding principles to make web content perceivable, operable, understandable and robust (POUR) without getting hung up on meeting a particular compliance level of a success criterion. This is not to diminish the testable criteria, they are needed to test in the throughout the process. It has been our experience that the POUR principles should be used to guide decision making.  

Our goal with this visualization is to help designers and developers understand the guidelines, not ignore them. 

Creating websites that meet the needs of people with disabilities including auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual impairments overlap with people with situational limitations such as being in  a loud environment, having limited use of hands, using a mobile device, using old hardware or limited access to bandwidth [Henry et all 2014]. There is a long list of products that were initially designed for people with disabilities and due to there incredible usefulness for everyone were mainstreamed [Jacobs]. The telephone, the typewriter, texting are to name a few.

If the guidelines are presented in a way that is more inline with the we make decisions during the design and development process, perhaps compliance rate would improve.

This poster aims to increase awareness of accessibility and the integration of accessibility considerations into mainstream design and development processes.

Visualization can help turn complex systems into something more understandable.

"10. for the blind and visually impaired, access information and services online gives them independence, self-reliance, control, ease of access, dignity and self-esteem. A person is not handicapped if she does not need help.  Making the government online information services accessible provides the visually impaired “substantive equality.”  This is like the ramp to permit wheelchair access to a building.  It is a ramp for the blind to access online services."  

By focusing on the guidelines's principles and clear action-based accessibility techniques we hope to encourage teams to integrate accessible practices early in their processes in order to improve accessibility for everyone.
