This poster focuses on the implementation of POUR principles by visualizing design and development decisions as a stairs. 
The visualization of the ramp (the numbered techniques for making HTML elements accessible) should not be viewed as a sequential process, since many are done concurrently during design and development.

The techniques are organized not in a sequential process but according to the relative amount of awareness, skill and resources that are needed to make and execute accessible decisions. The visualization is meant to focus on the guiding principles to make web content perceivable, operable, understandable and robust (POUR) without getting hung up on meeting a particular grade on success criterion. This is not to diminish the testable criteria, they are needed to test in the throughout the process. It has been our experience that the POUR principles should be used to guide decision making.  

Our goal with this visualization is to help designers and developers understand the guidelines, not ignore them. 

Creating websites that meet the needs of people with disabilities including auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual impairments overlap with people with situational limitations such as being in  a loud environment, having limited use of hands, using a mobile device, using old hardware or limited access to bandwidth [Henry et all 2014]. There is a long list of products that were initially designed for people with disabilities and due to there incredible usefulness for everyone were mainstreamed [Jacobs]. The telephone, the typewriter, texting are to name a few.

If the guidelines are presented in a way that is more inline with the we make decisions during the design and development process, perhaps compliance rate would improve.

This poster aims to increase awareness of accessibility and the integration of accessibility considerations into mainstream design and development processes.

"10. for the blind and visually impaired, access information and services online gives them independence, self-reliance, control, ease of access, dignity and self-esteem. A person is not handicapped if she does not need help.  Making the government online information services accessible provides the visually impaired “substantive equality.”  This is like the ramp to permit wheelchair access to a building.  It is a ramp for the blind to access online services."
