% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement

%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'

%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of

%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names

\begin{abstract}
\textit{Ramp it up} is an action-based guide to creating accessible websites. It is a visualization aid designed to help web teams integrate accessible design choices into their practices, thus resulting in websites that are more likely to comply with the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0). The poster aims to help all members of the web development team - designers, developers, writers and project managers - better understand what to do, and what it takes to make sites accessible. Each stair represents a content type or design decision that could potentially introduce a barrier to a person with a disability. Associated with each stair is list of accessible techniques that, when implemented, builds in the virtual the ramp ensuring access to the website content. The action-based techniques (or ramp) focuses making sites that are perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. By focusing on the guidelines's POUR principles we hope teams are better equipped to integrate accessible practices without getting lost in highly technical and sometimes confusing language of the success criteria.

\section{Introduction}
A long term study (14-year period)[Hanson & Richards] found low compliance rates with the WCAG, but also uncovered a growing trend to adhere to some criteria. A follow-up study [Richard & Hanson] found that at least part of the improved accessibility was a side effect of changes in design and coding practices, improved browser capabilities and concerns over page search engine rankings. In another study on developer perceptions [Lazar et al], a lack of awareness and knowledge of the WCAG was found to be the most significant barrier to web accessibility. These studies show that web teams continue to struggle with correct implementation of the WCAG and suggesting that aids that make the guidelines easier to understand and implement could improve web accessibility. This action-based guide intends to do just that, help people better understand how to build in the virtual ramp through accessible design choices.

\section{Building in the {\secit Virtual} Ramp}

\subsection{Text \& Solid Structure}

Electronic text-based content is accessible by nature. It can be rendered visually, auditorily and tactilely. Use HTML's built-in semantic structure [1] - headings, lists, quotes - to code meaning directly into your content. Keep the reading level as simple as possible. Define the natural language \& mark language changes. Ensure there is a doctype, charset \& a unique page title in each of your templates for a valid code base.

\subsection{Navigation, Links \& Landmarks}
Navigation, links and landmarks, like stepping stones, help you find your way. Use unique self-describing meaningful words for linked text. Keep links DRY [2] (do not repeat yourself over and over and over). Leave context changes - pop-ups, new tabs - in the control of the user. Use WAI-ARIA [3] landmark roles or HTML5 landmark tags to provide direct access to page content (formerly we used skip navigation links). Design well-planned, consistent navigation. Usability helps all users.

\subsection{Images \& Charts}
Provide meaningful text alternatives for all content images. The alt attribute is required, but can be left empty, if appropriate. For charts or complex images you may need to link to supplementary content or use the longdesc attribute. The goal of text alternatives is to maintain the meaning of the document whether you can see the image or not.

\subsection{Tables, Forms \& Interactives}
Simplify complex HTML structures \& user interactions wherever possible.
\subsubsection{Tables}
Use the rich semantic table mark-up available in HTML - thead, tfoot, tbody. Introduce tables with the caption element. Appropriately distinguish table header cells from table data cells (th, td) on rows and columns. Use tables only for tabular data - not content layout!

\subsubsection{Forms \& Interactives}
Keep forms simple - don't ask for data you don't need. Use \& associate labels for every form control. Use the button element when you need a button. Group form controls to create meaningful organization in forms - legend, fieldset, optgroup. Organization is good for all users. Design clear error identification \& intuitive error handling. Clearly tell the user where they have gone wrong, how to fix the problem and when they have succeeded. Provide reasonable time-outs (think user control). Employ WAI-ARIA [3] standard to define roles and behaviours that HTML cannot describe. This is particularly important for forms \& interactive structures that use forms (e.g. games, quizzes, etc.).

Note: most legal cases have happened around in-accessible tables \& forms [4].

\subsection{Colour \& Layout}
Don't rely on colour alone for meaning. Choose colours wisely \& test for sufficient contrast ratios. Avoid confusing colours. The Brewer Palette is a good resource. Use CSS for layout  \& consistency. Using CSS \& HTML together properly is best method in making your content accessible \& easier to maintain.

\subsection{Audio, Video \& Other formats}
Do not auto-play anything (think user control). Provide open or closed captions for audio and video. Describe video when the meaning cannot be understood by the soundtrack alone. Video description can be open or closed. Providing transcripts, in some cases (e.g. talking heads \& interviews), makes better sense than captions. For other formats, such as PDF or Word documents, first ask is there a reason not to use HTML? Follow the WCAG for content in Word documents and PDFs. PDFs must be tagged to be accessible [6].

\section{Conclusions}
When web design teams ramp up a website for users of assistive technology and other edge cases, the payoff happens at many levels. The website will likely be easier to find, be of a higher quality, be easier to maintain, last longer and work better for everyone - all of which contribute to a better return on the investment. Just like accessible ramps at building entrances, the virtual ramp built into websites benefits more than the intended audience.
