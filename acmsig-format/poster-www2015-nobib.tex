\begin{abstract}
Presented here is an action-based guide to create accessible websites. By focusing on accessibility rather than compliance this guide will help teams create sites that are perceivable, operable, understandable \& robust. The POUR principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) are what all the other layers of guidance in the WCAG aim to achieve. The simplified techniques presented here focus on accessibile design decisions \& reframe the WCAG's layers into something all members of the web team - designers, developers, writers \& managers - can understand. To build in the \textit{virtual ramp} the entire team needs to be aware, develop the skill \& demand the necessary resources.

\section{Introduction}
A long term study [4] found low compliance rates with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), but at the same time, uncovered a growing adherence to \textit{some} criteria. A follow-up study [10] found that at least part of the improved accessibility was a side effect of changes in coding practices, new browser capabilities \& concerns over page rankings. In another study [8], \textit{lack of awareness \& knowledge of the WCAG} was identified by the participants to be the most significant barrier to web accessibility. These studies show that web teams continue to struggle with correct implementation of the WCAG \& suggest that aids that make the guidelines easier to understand could improve implementation. This poster intends to do just that, present the guidelines in a way that keeps team members focused on accessibility \& building in the \textit{virtual ramp}.

\section{Building in the {\secit Virtual} Ramp}

\subsection{Text \& Solid Code Base}

Electronic text-based content is accessible by nature. It can be rendered visually, auditorily \& tactilely: Use HTML's built-in semantic structure [2,6] - headings, lists, quotes - to code meaning directly into your content. Keep the reading level as simple as possible. Define the natural language \& mark language changes. Ensure templates have a doctype, charset \& page title (a valid code base). Make page titles unique so users know they are in the right place.

\subsection{Navigation, Links \& Landmarks}
Navigation, links \& landmarks, like stepping stones, help you find your way [6]. Use unique self-describing meaningful words for linked text. Leave context changes - pop-ups, new tabs - in the control of the user. Use WAI-ARIA landmark roles [6], HTML5 landmark tags or skip-navigation links to provide direct access to page content. Design well-planned, consistent navigation to make sites accessible \& usable.

\subsection{Images \& Charts}
Provide meaningful text alternatives for all content images. The alt attribute is required, but can be left empty when appropriate. For charts or complex images you may need to link to supplementary content or use the longdesc attribute. The goal of text alternatives is to maintain the meaning of the document whether you can see the image or not.

\subsection{Tables, Forms \& Interactives}
For complex HTML structures, consider simplification whenever possible. For successful interaction the keyboard must be your guide.
\subsubsection{Table structure conveys meaning}
Use the rich semantic mark-up available for tables - caption, thead, tfoot, tbody - to make data realtionships clear. Appropriately distinguish table header cells from table data cells (th, td) on rows \& columns. Do not use tables for layout. They are for tabular data only!
\subsubsection{Forms \& Interactives are complex by nature}
Keep user control \& keyboard access top of mind. Use \& associate labels for every form control. Use the button element when you need a button. Exploit group form controls to create meaningful organization - legend, fieldset, optgroup. Organizational meaning is good for usability. Design clear error identification \& intuitive error handling by clearly telling the user where they have gone wrong, how to fix the problem \& when they have succeeded. Provide reasonable time-outs (think user control). Employ WAI-ARIA [6] to define roles \& behaviours that HTML cannot describe. This is particularly important for forms \& interactive structures that use forms.

Note: most legal cases have happened around inaccessible tables \& forms [9].

\subsection{Colour \& Layout}
CSS is the standard to use for presentation. Use it correctly to maintain global control of your layout \& design. Using CSS \& HTML together properly is best method in making your content accessible \& easier to maintain. Choose colours wisely \& test for sufficient contrast ratios. Avoid confusing colours [1]. Don't rely on colour alone for meaning.

\subsection{Audio, Video \& Other formats}
Like images multimedia need text alternatives to be made accessible. Provide captions for video \& transcripts for audio. For ultimate accessibilty describe video when the meaning cannot be understood by the soundtrack alone. Controls for media must be operable by the keyboard. Do not auto-play anything (think user control). For other formats, such as PDF or Word documents, first ask is there a reason not to use HTML? When HTML is not an option, follow the same principles (WCAG) discussed here to make content in documents accessible.

\section{Conclusions}
Creating websites that meet the needs of people with disabilities overlaps with people with situational limitations such as being in a loud environment, having limited use of hands, using a mobile device, using old hardware or having limited access to bandwidth [5]. Just as access ramps \& curbcuts benefit more than just people in wheelchairs, the \textit{virtual ramp} or \textit{electronic curbcut} [7] benefits more than just people using assitive technology. Making accessibility a priority in the design process helps us build better websites \& brings us closer to a universal web [5].
